# WHO: Life Expectancy Analysis
This repository contains the code and analysis files for exploring the Life Expectancy dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). The dataset provides various features related to healthcare and socioeconomic factors, which can be used to predict life expectancy.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from Kaggle and can be accessed at the following link: [Life Expectancy - WHO](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who). Please download the dataset from the provided link before running the code.

# Objective
The objective of this task is to perform EDA on the Life Expectancy dataset that can provide meaningful insights and visualizations so that we can create a predictive model to predict Life Expectancy.

# Problem Statement
The analysis should aim to answer questions such as:
* Are there anomalies in the dataset that need to be addressed?
* Are there any significant differences in life expectancy across countries or regions?
* Are there any trends or patterns in life expectancy over time?
* What are the factors influencing life expectancy?
* Can a predictive model (Random Forest) be developed to accurately predict life expectancy?

# Files
* **AboutDataset.txt:** a txt file contains short explanation for each column in the dataset
* **LifeExpectancyAnalysis.Rmd:** A R Markdown file contains the source code used for the project
* **LifeExpectancyAnalysis.html:** This HTML file is a converted version of the R Markdown file
* **Poster.pdf:** This file is a visual summary of the project, which includes images, charts, and graphs to illustrate key findings
